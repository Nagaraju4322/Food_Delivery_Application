# 🍽️ Food Delivery Application
# 📌 Overview

The Food Delivery Application is a full-stack Java web application that allows users to browse restaurants, explore menus, add food items to a cart, and place orders efficiently.
The application is built using Java Servlets, deployed on Apache Tomcat, and uses MySQL for persistent data storage.

To maintain clean code architecture and scalability, the project follows the DAO (Data Access Object) Design Pattern along with the MVC architecture.
